# KPI
## Types of KPI
Available types of KPI are
* 'continuous_without_deadline': Follow one number of the course of time. Only the most recent number is relevant and how it compares to the goal. Previous data provide context in the detailed view.
* 'cumulative_number_over_year': Input measurements are numbers, which are first grouped by year and then added up. The current year is of interest and how it compares to the goal. Other years are presented in the detail view to provide a comparison.
